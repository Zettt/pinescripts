## Key issues found

- The two multiplier inputs are both titled “Keltner Bands Normal Multiplier,” which is confusing; titles should be distinct for Tight vs Normal to prevent user error. [^21]
- Unused or misused variables exist (e.g., atrlength and keltnerEMA are defined but never applied in band calculations), and comments such as “plot mean deivations” contain typos and mislead maintenance. [^21]
- “firstFreeBarUp/Down” are states (being inside a band) rather than event conditions; ta.barssince() should be applied to a discrete event like “first bar back inside after being outside,” not a persistent state. [^21]
- Cross logic is asymmetric: longCross uses wick (high >= upper) while shortCross uses close (close <= lower); consistency and a user option to choose wick vs body is advisable. [^21]


## 20 improvements for v3.0

- Fix input labels and UX
    - Give unique, precise titles and tooltips, e.g., “Tight Multiplier,” “Normal Multiplier,” “Extreme Multiplier,” and add short descriptions to clarify the visual/logic effects. [^21]
    - Change showOnlyFirstSignal from a hardcoded variable to a user input input.bool with a tooltip explaining “emit only the first signal after a reset.” [^21]
    - Replace bandsToUse input.string with an input.enum to reduce typos and speed comparisons. [^21]
- Make band math explicit and configurable
    - Actually use atrlength by adding a user input for ATR length and computing Keltner bands explicitly: basis = selected MA of close; range = ATR(atrLength); up = basis + mult*range; down = basis − mult*range; this removes ambiguity from ta.kc defaults and uses the declared atrlength. [^21]
    - Add a selectable “Mean type” input (EMA/SMA/WMA/RMA/HMA) so users can adapt the “mean reversion” anchor to instrument characteristics. [^21]
    - Offer a setting to compute bands from typical price hlc3 or ohlc4, not only close, which can reduce noise on some markets. [^21]
- Correct “free bars” into events and improve deviations
    - Redefine “first free bar back inside” as a discrete event: backInsideUpper = (high <= up and close <= up) and (high[^21] > up[^21]); barsSinceUpperReentry = ta.barssince(backInsideUpper); same for lower; this aligns with the intended “first bar back in” logic. [^21]
    - Compute and optionally color by a price-to-band z-score-like metric, e.g., dev = (close − basis)/(ATR*mult) to make deviation intensity consistent across multipliers. [^21]
    - Add a user option to color only bodies, only wicks, or entire bars, and a transparency control to avoid overpowering chart themes. [^21]
- Standardize crossing logic and add signal modes
    - Provide a “Signal source” option: Wick (high/low crossing), Close (close crossing), or Confirmed (barstate.isconfirmed) to minimize repaint and match different styles. [^21]
    - Normalize long/short cross symmetry: either both use wick or both use close, controlled by the “Signal source” input to avoid bias. [^21]
- Improve visuals and context
    - Use fill() to shade between upper and lower bands (tight, normal, extreme) with separate toggles and transparency so traders can visually parse regimes at a glance. [^21]
    - Add a “Squeeze” detector measuring normalized bandwidth, e.g., (up − down)/basis, with a threshold input to mark compression expansions. [^21]
    - Consolidate colors into var color constants and add a “Color-blind palette” switch to enhance accessibility. [^21]
- Alerts and automation
    - Add alertcondition() for all user-relevant events: upper/lower band crosses, first bar back inside, free-bar breakouts, and squeeze begin/end, with descriptive messages and placeholders for ticker/timeframe. [^21]
    - Provide an option to output compact labels instead of shapes, reducing clutter while maintaining alert functionality. [^21]
- Multi-timeframe and filters
    - Add a higher-timeframe trend filter: compute HTF basis and require alignment (e.g., long signals only when close > HTF basis) to reduce countertrend trades; expose HTF timeframe input. [^21]
    - Include optional volume or volatility filters (e.g., above average volume or ATR percentile) to gate signals in dead markets. [^21]
    - Session and day-of-week filters let users avoid illiquid hours or specific weekdays known to skew behavior. [^21]
- Strategy/backtest mode
    - Add a “Mode” switch: Indicator vs Strategy; when Strategy, generate entries on band-cross or reentry events, and exits via stop/target inputs (ATR-based or fixed %), with slippage/commission inputs to produce realistic stats. [^21]
    - Provide optional pyramiding and max concurrent signals per direction to reflect “show only first” behavior consistently in backtests. [^21]
- Refactoring and maintenance
    - Factor repeated logic (tight/normal/extreme) into a small function returning basis/up/down for the selected regime to reduce duplication and potential drift between branches. [^21]
    - Clean typos and dead code: remove unused keltnerEMA, actually apply atrlength, fix stray commented lines, and correct comments like “mean deivations” for clarity. [^21]


## Example event fix (snippet)

- Replace the current “first free bar” state with an event and use it with ta.barssince() to ensure discrete, non-repainting triggers. [^21]

```pine
// Example for the chosen band set “upBand/downBand”
insideUpper   = high <= upBand and close <= upBand
outsideUpper1 = high[^21] > upBand[^21]
reentryUpper  = insideUpper and outsideUpper1
barsSinceReentryUpper = ta.barssince(reentryUpper)

// Same idea for lower band
insideLower   = low >= downBand and close >= downBand
outsideLower1 = low[^21] < downBand[^21]
reentryLower  = insideLower and outsideLower1
barsSinceReentryLower = ta.barssince(reentryLower)
```

- This change makes “reentry” a one-bar event that is easy to alert on and to measure with ta.barssince for cooldown logic. [^21]


## Optional extensions

- Add an on-chart summary table showing the current regime, squeeze state, last signal timing, and HTF alignment to speed decision-making. [^21]
- Offer an “adaptive” profile that scales multipliers or ATR length by recent volatility percentiles, keeping bands effective across regimes without manual retuning. [^21]


## License notes

- The header already references MPL 2.0; keep the notice intact, and if distributing modified versions, preserve copyright and license notices and clarify modifications. [^21]
- Consider adding a brief LICENSE section in the script’s description pointing to MPL terms for clarity for end users and downstream modifiers. [^21]


## Remove outright

- Remove the **Advanced Mode** toggle, since it only flips colors/shapes and adds cognitive load without changing the trading logic. [^21]
- Remove Free Bar “star” markers (plotchar ★), as they duplicate the idea of band crosses/re-entries and clutter the chart. [^21]
- Remove the Mean Deviations bar coloring (barcolor heatmap), which often overpowers candles and duplicates the role of clear, discrete signals. [^21]
- Remove plotting of multiple band systems simultaneously (tight/normal/extreme) to cut visual noise and prevent conflicting cues. [^21]


## Consolidate or deprecate

- Remove bandsToUse and use a single, primary band set for both plotting and signal logic to avoid divergence between visuals and alerts. [^21]
- Remove separate “Show Tight Band?” and “Show Extreme Band?” toggles; expose one band set with a single multiplier instead of three fixed presets. [^21]
- Remove the separate “Show Mean EMA?” middle-line toggle; if a basis is needed, keep it as a style option under one band set rather than a distinct feature. [^21]
- Remove asymmetric cross definitions (wick for long, close for short) by consolidating to one signal mode; asymmetry confuses interpretation. [^21]


## Replace with simpler alternatives

- Replace “Show Only First Signal” with a numeric cooldown bars input for explicit, flexible de-duplication. [^21]
- Standardize on one unobtrusive marker for all signals, replacing shape-style toggles tied to Advanced Mode. [^21]
- Keep a single accessible color palette that reads well on light/dark themes, removing multiple aesthetic-only color options. [^21]
- Use one consistent iconography so the same event always looks the same, improving scan-ability. [^21]


## Streamline inputs

- Collapse duplicate multiplier concepts into one multiplier slider with sensible defaults for simplicity. [^21]
- Remove inputs that only affect aesthetics, retaining those that materially change calculations or alerts. [^21]
- Prefer enums over strings and numeric sliders where appropriate to reduce ambiguity and user error. [^21]


## Logic alignment

- Ensure a single source of truth for both display and signal checks by unifying the band set used for plotting and logic. [^21]
- Collapse overlapping event types (e.g., cross vs “free bar breakout”) into a single, unambiguous crossing definition to avoid double signaling. [^21]
- Prefer discrete events over persistent-state pseudo-events to reduce confusion and improve alert clarity. [^21]


## Migration note

- Removing these features and consolidating inputs aligns the script with a simpler UX, fewer redundant options, and consistent behavior across visuals and alerts for a cleaner v3.0 release. [^21]
